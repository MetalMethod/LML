#Artifficial Neural Networks

#what I think is needed:

# Data pre processing
# a array of features X
# add Random weights
# Activation Function (relu or sigmoid)
# output to ^y with sigmoid
# feed hidden layers and repeat until reaching output y

# calculate Error and Cost function
# backpropagation and update weights

# run again for all the rows until Epoch.
