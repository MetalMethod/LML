# Why LML?

I started this journey as a personal interest, just because I like a lot the subjects of artificial intelligence and robotics. After a while reading about Machine Learning, I got hooked to the idea of learn to write programs that can learn by themselves. I’m just in the beginning of this adventure as this is a vast and complex field. So I decided that I´ll give it time and invest in a few practical online courses on ML and Deep Learning to build a background on the field.
